Plesk Panel integration with Zimbra

My aim is to make Zimbra's free version an option as an email server to Plesk Panel.

Ideas and contributions are always welcome.

TODO:

from Plesk:

- When an email account gets deleted from plesk, it also disappears from Zimbra.
- Changing email passwords (by customer's admin user)
- mailing lists
- mailbox redirects
- email aliases
- .. and much more


Excellent sources for some more info..
